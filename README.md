# IMAGEBOARDS (PHP 8.4.1+)

each folder, like /sqlite3 or /json will contain simple imageboards for the noted db. For example, each folder in the /sqlite folder will be its own sqlite app. 

The collection of boards here is more of a starter kit than a production ready library of code. HOWEVER, all the apps you find here will work on php 8.4.1 and above, ALL of them are small enough for you to feed to chatgpt to edit or audit, and all of them are made to be somewhat secure (secure for PHP, that is). 

Lets get real. There are not many logical use cases for PHP, as Golang and best of all RUST is far superior by all objective measures. Fake click bait youtube titles (any prime or theo clickbait title video) that highlights the lang of the week just go in circles and make you stupider. Ask AI a NON LEADING set of questions, and AI will tell you that Rust is far superior- to run a machine in space for 50 years straight or to run a secure and ultra fast imageboard. Make NO mistake. Today, and likely for a long time, Rust lang is god. 

There are so many  php imageboards on github and similar, most every single one (including mine) have security vulns. PHP is what it is. HOWEVER, all the people who do not bother to code in the latest php versions are making absurdly outdated code. Currently the latest PHP version is 8.4.1 and anything less could be improved by making it up to php 8.4.1 standards (or whatever the latest version is). Using the latest PHP version, currently PHP 8.4.1, is crucial for ensuring optimal performance, security, and functionality in your web applications. Each new PHP release includes important updates that address security vulnerabilities, making your applications more resistant to potential exploits. Additionally, the latest version introduces enhanced performance optimizations and modern features that improve efficiency and enable developers to write cleaner, more maintainable code. PHP 8.4.1 also ensures compatibility with the latest frameworks and tools, reducing potential conflicts or deprecated functionality. By using the latest version, you future-proof your projects, avoid technical debt, and provide a better, more secure experience for users.

# Why bother with PHP? 
Why bother with php then? Well, its easy, simple, and fun to try and make a decent php app that is somewhat performant and secure. It can NEVER be done tho. You will ALWAYS need to update your php app, in contrast to a Rust app that can run 50 years straight without rebooting. SO- since you KNOW that future updates will be needed, make your code as small and efficient as possible. Make it modular so its easy to work with. Probably the BEST advice is to make sure it fits into the AI limitations such as Chat-GPT! PHP imageboards that you download and are too big to feed to ChatGPT to audit are just  stupid to run. Afraid of being hacked and having users ip leaked? Just do NOT use ip in any database! The K.I.S.S way (Keep it simple stupid) and LESS IS MORE ethos is what you need a solid grasp of in order to make decent php imageboards. 

Make NO mistake. If you want performance and security, RUST LANG or GO is far superior to PHP. It is a whole different world.
