# IMAGEBOARDS (PHP 8.4.1+)

PHP simple imageboards- all tested on [PHP 8.4.1+] this will be a HUGE collection of working boards.


Why not use existing image boards?

Vichan- devs do not bother making it work on latest php version, but they all gas-light people by saying it is being worked on. It has been 4 years and it still does not even nearly work on the latest version of php. Absurd. 

Lynxchan/JSChan  Node Js is not secure by design. Deps that call on deps that call on deps make it absurdly impossible to make secure. I think lynxchan looks and acts the best of any imageboard, but good luck keeping it updated when new versions of ubuntu or rocky come out. Of note, devs like lynxchan maker REFUSE to make standard install scripts - because they KNOW that the app is not secure and never will be. Always the excuses from devs as to why NOT to make a standard install script from a blank server- but professional apps like ghost blog have full install scripts. Lynxchan/jschan are both FAR from that professional level. Regardless of the excuses, if any app does NOT have a standard install script from scratch, then the app is not consistent and never will be. HOW the f can you test and dev an app when everyone is on a different environment running the app? To not have a consistent install script from blank server is utterly absurd.

Tinyib- nice, moved to rocket9, but quit dev a while ago. Lots of deprications, like video upload. You can fix the deprications, but then new issues pop up here and there and you realize solidly that the code is just too old. It should be entirely redone to PHP 8.4.1+ standards. If anyone totally re-wrote tinyib to strictly modern php (8.4.1 +) standards, i would just use it in production. So far its still too big to feed to ChatGPT to modernize. Future versions of chatgpt should be able to instantly fix tinyib or Vichan to latest standards tho. 

In contrast to the above apps, some of which have hundreds of files, one can do nearly the same thing with a single page or 2 of php, and keep it updated, AND make it work for the latest php version AND not have install issues. Note--- I've made some Rust imageboards, and AI is almost there to make fully awesome imageboards and edit and update and audit the code. I'm just waiting a tiny bit- AI is literally a step away to the standards of being able to make imageboards in Rust. Chatgpt can do it now, but the boards are not good enough to expect a huge following and lots of people to use. VERY close tho!! Once ChatGPT gets a tiny bit better at rust coding, I will never touch another lang again. Also Rust web dev like Actix web or Rocket web is almost there... rust web dev has come an incredibly far way and is almost there to the level where its stupidity to use anything else. 

each folder, like /sqlite3 or /json will contain simple imageboards for the noted db. For example, each folder in the /sqlite folder will be its own sqlite app. 

The collection of boards here is more of a starter kit than a production ready library of code. HOWEVER, all the apps you find here will work on php 8.4.1 and above, ALL of them are small enough for you to feed to chatgpt to edit or audit, and all of them are made to be somewhat secure (secure for PHP, that is). 

Lets get real. There are not many logical use cases for PHP, as Golang and best of all RUST is far superior by all objective measures. Fake click bait youtube titles (any prime or theo clickbait title video) that highlights the lang of the week just go in circles and make you stupider. Ask AI a NON LEADING set of questions, and AI will tell you that Rust is far superior- to run a machine in space for 50 years straight or to run a secure and ultra fast imageboard. Make NO mistake. Today, and likely for a long time, Rust lang is god. 

There are so many  php imageboards on github and similar, most every single one (including mine) have security vulns. PHP is what it is. HOWEVER, all the people who do not bother to code in the latest php versions are making absurdly outdated code. Currently the latest PHP version is 8.4.1 and anything less could be improved by making it up to php 8.4.1 standards (or whatever the latest version is). Using the latest PHP version, currently PHP 8.4.1, is crucial for ensuring optimal performance, security, and functionality in your web applications. Each new PHP release includes important updates that address security vulnerabilities, making your applications more resistant to potential exploits. Additionally, the latest version introduces enhanced performance optimizations and modern features that improve efficiency and enable developers to write cleaner, more maintainable code. PHP 8.4.1 also ensures compatibility with the latest frameworks and tools, reducing potential conflicts or deprecated functionality. By using the latest version, you future-proof your projects, avoid technical debt, and provide a better, more secure experience for users.

# Why bother with PHP? 
Why bother with php then? Well, its easy, simple, and fun to try and make a decent php app that is somewhat performant and secure. It can NEVER be done tho. You will ALWAYS need to update your php app, in contrast to a Rust app that can run 50 years straight without rebooting. SO- since you KNOW that future updates will be needed, make your code as small and efficient as possible. Make it modular so its easy to work with. Probably the BEST advice is to make sure it fits into the AI limitations such as Chat-GPT! PHP imageboards that you download and are too big to feed to ChatGPT to audit are just  stupid to run. Afraid of being hacked and having users ip leaked? Just do NOT use ip in any database! The K.I.S.S way (Keep it simple stupid) and LESS IS MORE ethos is what you need a solid grasp of in order to make decent php imageboards. 

Make NO mistake. If you want performance and security, RUST LANG or GO is far superior to PHP. It is a whole different world.


PHP, like any widely-used programming language, has a history of security vulnerabilities, often arising from its flexibility, ease of use, and prevalence in web development. Many of these vulnerabilities stem from improper handling of input data, misconfiguration, or outdated code practices. Below, we explore some common security concerns in PHP applications:

## 1. SQL Injection
SQL injection remains one of the most well-known vulnerabilities in PHP applications. This occurs when user input is directly embedded in SQL queries without proper validation or sanitization. For example, if a PHP script concatenates user input into a query, attackers can inject malicious SQL code to access or manipulate databases. The introduction of prepared statements and parameterized queries in modern PHP versions, particularly with the PDO and MySQLi extensions, helps mitigate this risk, but legacy codebases often fail to adopt these best practices.

## 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
PHP applications that dynamically generate HTML content can inadvertently expose users to XSS attacks. This happens when user-generated input, such as comments or form submissions, is embedded into a webpage without adequate escaping or encoding. An attacker can inject malicious scripts, potentially stealing cookies, hijacking user sessions, or performing other malicious activities. The use of functions like htmlspecialchars() and modern frameworks with built-in templating engines helps reduce the risk, but improper implementation leaves many applications vulnerable.

## 3. Remote Code Execution (RCE)
Improper validation of input data in PHP scripts can lead to remote code execution vulnerabilities. For example, poorly configured file upload scripts may allow attackers to upload and execute malicious PHP files. Similarly, functions like eval(), exec(), and include() can be exploited when user input is improperly sanitized. Modern PHP versions have introduced features like disable_functions and strict configuration options to limit these risks, but older or misconfigured environments remain targets.

## 4. File Inclusion Vulnerabilities
PHPâ€™s dynamic inclusion capabilities, such as include() and require(), can lead to Local File Inclusion (LFI) or Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerabilities. If user input is used to construct file paths without validation, attackers can manipulate requests to include sensitive local files or even malicious external scripts. This can expose sensitive configuration files, such as php.ini or config.php, or enable further exploits like RCE.

## 5. Session Hijacking
PHP relies heavily on sessions for state management, which is critical for authentication and maintaining user data across requests. Poorly implemented session management can lead to session fixation or session hijacking. Attackers can steal session IDs, either via XSS, insecure cookies, or network interception, allowing them to impersonate authenticated users. Properly configuring session settings, such as enabling session.cookie_secure, using HTTPS, and regenerating session IDs frequently, can mitigate these risks.

## 6. Deserialization Vulnerabilities
PHP's serialization mechanisms, such as serialize() and unserialize(), have historically been exploited in deserialization attacks. These attacks occur when untrusted serialized data is deserialized, potentially allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code or manipulate application logic. Modern PHP versions provide safer alternatives, like json_encode() and json_decode(), and newer features such as object-based whitelisting during deserialization reduce the attack surface.

## 7. Weak Cryptographic Practices
Older PHP applications may use outdated or insecure cryptographic functions, such as md5() or sha1(), for password hashing and data security. These hashing algorithms are considered insecure against modern computational attacks. The PHP password_hash() function, introduced in PHP 5.5, and its integration with strong algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2, provides a robust alternative, but many legacy systems still rely on insecure practices.

## 8. Misconfigured PHP Settings
PHPâ€™s configuration options, such as display_errors, allow_url_fopen, and expose_php, can unintentionally reveal sensitive information to attackers. For instance, displaying detailed error messages on production servers can expose file paths, query structures, or application logic. Similarly, allowing remote URL inclusion (allow_url_include) can introduce vulnerabilities. Ensuring proper configuration and disabling unnecessary features is essential for reducing these risks.

## 9. Dependency Vulnerabilities
Many PHP applications rely on third-party libraries and frameworks, which may themselves have vulnerabilities. If these dependencies are outdated or unpatched, they can introduce significant security risks. Tools like Composer and vulnerability scanners help identify and update insecure dependencies, but developers must actively monitor and manage their libraries.

While PHPâ€™s ecosystem has matured significantly with the introduction of better security practices and features, its long history and widespread use make it a frequent target for attackers. To mitigate these risks, developers should stay updated with the latest PHP releases, employ secure coding practices, and leverage modern frameworks that prioritize security. Regular code reviews, vulnerability scanning, and adherence to best practices are critical for reducing the attack surface and ensuring application security.

IF you run any of the boards here on php 8.4.1 or higher, and it does not work, trust me, its you, not the code. ALL the code here is tested and working. Make sure to chmod the dir and files properly if it does not work, that is the most common reason an app would not work. 

# Make ZERO mistake. PHP is fun to mess with, but RUST LANG is far superior.
